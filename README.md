# NorthstarTF

The NorthstarTF repository holds the code for the [northstar.tf](https://northstar.tf) website.

## Developing

To render the webpage locally you will need to have [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed.

Then run

```sh
yarn
```

once to install the necessary dependencies.

After that

```sh
yarn dev
```
to build the webpage and run a local webserver displaying the changes.
It should live update everytime you perform any changes display them.
